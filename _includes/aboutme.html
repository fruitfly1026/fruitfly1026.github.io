    <h1>About me</h1>
        <article>

        <p><strong>I will be join High-Performance Computing group of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA in August, 2018.</strong></p><br/>

        <p>I am a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in <a href="http://www.cse.gatech.edu">Computational Science & Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.gatech.edu">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>. 
        I am working as a graduate research assistant in <a href="http://hpcgarage.org/wp/">HPC Garage</a> with Professor <a href="http://vuduc.org/index.php">Richard Vuduc</a>. 
        Before, I was a research intern of IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center and Intel Parallel Computing Lab in the summers of 2015 and 2016 respectively.
        My current research emphasizes on optimizing tensor algorithms such as tensor decompositions and fundamental tensor operations, such as tensor-matrix products especially for sparse data by utilizing various parallel architectures.</p><br/>

        <p>In the past, I have received a Ph.D. degree from <a href="http://english.ict.cas.cn">Institute of Computing Technology</a> at <a href="http://english.cas.cn">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>. 
        My research was about auto-tuning method and optimization for irregular algorithms, including sparse matrix vector multiplication, algebriac multi-grid, and dynamic programming on parallel architectures. 
        I received my B.S. in Information and Computing Science from <a href="http://en.dlut.edu.cn">Dalian University of Technology</a>. </p>
